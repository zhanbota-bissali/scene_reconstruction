# scene_reconstruction

The aim of the project is to obtain a 3D reconstruction of a 3D scene. 
Which includes selection and calibration of a camera, selection of an adequate scene, 
selection of an adequate number of views on the scene, 
extraction and matching feature points between views, 
computation of the fundamental matrix between views, 
and finally 3D points cloud reconstruction.
